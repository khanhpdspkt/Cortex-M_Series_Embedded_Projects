|   | Time domain | frequency domain |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Fourier Transfrom     | continuous, aperiodic     | continuous, aperiodic      |
| Fourier Series     | continuous, aperiodic <br/> (or continus, only the value in a finite duration is known)    | discrete, aperiodic       |
| Discrete Time Fourier Transfrom     | discrete, aperiodic     | continuous, periodic      |
| **Discrete Fourier Transfrom**     | discrete, aperiodic <br/> (or discrete, **only the value in a finite duration is known**)     | discrete, periodic      |
